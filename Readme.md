# Registration for tournament!

Hi! I've started learning ASP .NET Core 2 MVC framework and this is my first Web Application I've created some time ago. Main goal for this one was to develop application with form that participants can register for tournament and collect all this data in database integrated with EF Core framework. 

I've also used Micorosft Azure Services for hosting application and Logic Apps for sending Emails and SMS with confirmation of register to users. 

## Technologies
This web application contains two layers which was written in following technologies:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (bootstrap framework), JavaScript
- **Backend:** C# ASP .NET Core 2 MVC, EF Core + **Micorosft Azure Services:** App Service, SQL Server + SQL Database, Logic App
